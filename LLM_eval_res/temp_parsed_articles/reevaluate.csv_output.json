    "ARTICLE": "FIFA's handling of the 2022 Qatar World Cup legacy fund has been met with criticism from human rights groups, including Amnesty International. The organization has expressed concerns that the fund does not provide direct compensation to the families of migrant workers harmed during the preparations for the event. Despite generating a record £6bn from the World Cup, FIFA resisted calls for a £350m compensation fund for the families of workers who were injured or who had died, instead committing to a legacy fund. The legacy fund has been criticized for not addressing the severe harms suffered by migrant workers in Qatar, with Amnesty International stating that it 'does absolutely nothing for the families who lost loved ones in Qatar and were plunged into poverty as a result.'\n\nFIFA is facing ongoing controversies and challenges, including concerns over human rights, labor exploitation, and data privacy. The organization has been criticized for its handling of the women's soccer program in Canada, as well as broader concerns about corruption, bribery, and human rights abuses. The Qatari government's stance on the 2022 Qatar World Cup legacy fund remains unclear, despite potential support for its objectives, amidst criticism from Amnesty International.\n\nFIFA has commissioned an independent report to advise on its responsibilities to migrant workers in Qatar, which is yet to be published. The organization has also committed to a legacy fund, which will be invested in social programmes across various regions, in collaboration with the hosts, World Health Organization, World Trade Organization, and the United Nations Refugee Agency. However, Amnesty International has expressed concerns that the fund does not provide direct compensation to the families of migrant workers harmed during the preparations for the event.\n\nFIFA faces future challenges, including the potential hosting of the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which may raise similar concerns about human rights and labor exploitation.",

    "ARTICLE": "China's economic recovery has been marked by a significant improvement in key indicators, including foreign trade and manufacturing activity, as well as steady performance in investment and industrial production. This recovery momentum has led multiple foreign institutions, including UBS and Goldman Sachs, to revise up their China 2024 growth forecasts. With its GDP expanding 4.8 percent year on year in the first three quarters of the year and on course to realize an annual growth target of around 5 percent, China remains the biggest growth engine of the world economy.\n\nInvestments in high-tech manufacturing and services have surged in China, bolstering sectors like green technology, digital economy, and modern infrastructure, and contributing to the resilience and upgrading of the global industrial chains. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics highlights the acceleration of innovation-driven growth, with the value-added output of high-tech manufacturing industries growing by 9.4 percent year-on-year in October.\n\nChina has emerged as a global leader in green development, making significant strides in clean energy and sustainable technologies. With a rising 'green quotient' in its social and economic development, China is among the countries that have achieved the fastest reductions in energy intensity, largely due to the rapid expansion of its new energy sector.\n\nHowever, despite these positive developments, the outlook for China's economy remains uncertain due to ongoing trade tensions and other challenges. Economists are divided on how damaging another round of China-U.S. trade tensions could be, with some estimating that a full-blown global trade war could shave 2 percentage points off China's GDP.\n\nExperts believe that technology, rather than systemic reform, will drive China's next growth phase. To achieve this, it is essential to improve corporate productivity and move beyond reliance on investment-led growth.",
